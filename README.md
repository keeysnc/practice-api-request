# practice-api-request
Wanted to see how fetch and other modern api calls works under the hood. Being a huge anime fan I practiced this by making an GET request to the Studio Ghibli api pulling and displaying all there films into a simple card wireframe layout. This was simply practice for a more detailed application so I didn't put too much effort into designing or styling.
